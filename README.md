## Description
This program allows employers to quickly generate a display of all of their employees, along with relevant employee info.

## Installation Instructions
Clone this repository into bash or terminal and change into the Employer_Team_Manager directory. From there, run node app in the command line.

## Usage Information
The user will be prompted with a series of questions about each employee. The questions differ slightly based on the type of employee. After the user responds to all of the questions about an employee, they have the option to continue with another employee, until they have answered the questions for all of their employees. Then, they can open the team.html file in their browser to reveal an aesthetically pleasing array of their employees and all relevant information.
